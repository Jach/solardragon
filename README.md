# SolarDragon

For a long time I've wanted to make an arcade style game like [SolarWolf](https://www.pygame.org/shredwheat/solarwolf/index.shtml), which itself is an homage to an old Atari game SolarFox. This is that project.

(You can watch me play SolarWolf somewhat badly [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpiQmBPAmOE).

Initially, however, this is just going to begin as a reimplementation of SolarWolf, with its original assets too, but in Common Lisp with my lgame
library.

My rough plan is something like this:

* Implement the rest of the menu functionality, more or less
* Add music and sfx at least for menu
* Add a starfield bg
* Recreate the first few levels at least one by one
* Make a simple in-game level editor
* Try making a few of my own levels
* Replace graphics / sounds with something else
* Consider new or different gameplay mechanics
* Go through the effort of creating binaries for distribution,
  maybe even try to release on steam or at least itchio...
